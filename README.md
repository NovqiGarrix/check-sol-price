## Introduction

A RESTFull API that can checks Solana's price and send an email containing the price informations to your email. You can configure your email, and others neccesary variables in the `.env` file.

Because I'm using `nodemailer` library with gmail as the service, you have to activate this gmail feature: https://bit.ly/3MrzuLG. NOTE: Please note that I'm not taking any of your account information!.

## Deploy?

Personally, I've deployed this Node.js program on Heroku.
